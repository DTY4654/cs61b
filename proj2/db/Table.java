/**
 * To get a better handle on this project, spend the rest of this lab creating a Table class, which includes:
 *
 * A constructor.
 * An addRow method.
 * A main method that creates table T1 from this lab using the constructor and addRow methods.
 * There is no specific API for this task. That is, you can use whatever signatures you want for the constructor
 * and addRow methods. Pick any instance variables that you think will allow you to achieve those objectives.
 *
 * It's OK to assume that all types are int for now.
 *
 * Some recommendations: Your constructor should not take a collection of rows. The number and names of the columns
 * should be immutable (See 2/15 lecture for a definition of immutability).
 *
 * The most important part of your design for this project is how you'll store your tables:
 * simpler design might use a Table class only, which stores everything in a String[][].
 *
 *
 * We strongly encourage you to get the internal functionality working first (i.e. joins) before implementing
 * the parsing and execution of commands. After completing an internal feature, write your own unit tests to
 * verify that it works, and don't move on until you do so. Once you have a solid foundation, try to get commands
 * such as create table, print and some basic selects working. In addition, don't try and implement all internal
 * functionality at once. Some examples of starting with the basic functionality:

    Don't try to implement assorted types at first, start by assuming everything is a string.
    Don't try to implement the joining of many tables at first, start with just the join of two tables.
    Don't try to implement multiple conditional statements at first, start with just one conditional.
    Don't try to implement the full select clause definition at first. Start with selecting rows from one table,
    then move on to more complicated selects.
